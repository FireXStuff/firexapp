Welcome to FireX App's documentation!
=====================================

FireX is a general-purpose automation platform that enables users to build complex, tractable, extensible workflows.
The Python programming language is used to write tasks, which assemble into workflows. Through Flame, a sophisticated
visualization tool, even the most daunting workflows can be understood and extended across multiple teams with different
goals. FireX also aggregates data across all workflow executions, enabling users to monitor, analyze and alarm at the
task level -- a granularity users decide by writing lightly annotated Python code.
